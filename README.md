# CSE264 Final Project

## Project members: Jessica Vogel, Caroline Geiger, Eddie Diggs, Anousha Mehta, Quinn Robertson, Matt Sireci

## App Name:
Shwap

## Web App Functionality:
The app will store shirts in a database and allow user the means to trade and swap shirts with one another.

## User story/use case:
Our app is a trade app where Lehigh students can swap shirts. A student must login with their Lehigh email to confirm their a student. Once logged in, a student is required to post one shirt and label its size (XS, S, M, L, XL, XL+), color, and sleeve length. After they’ve posted their shirt, they are allowed to see the main swap page where all the current posted shirts from other students are. They can filter the shirts by size, color, or length. They have the option to post more shirts, but it’s only mandatory to post 1 at first. If they (user 1) sees a shirt they want, user 1 clicks on a button on that post that initiates the trade. It then sends an email to the user (user 2) who owns the shirt user 1 wants. In that email it links to user 1's shirt page which shows all the shirts user 1 has posted. They can then trade in their emails. You can delete a shirt off your page at any time.

## Techincal Design:
We will use MongoDB as back end database. We’ll use Node in back end. NginX as a web server. We will use Javascript, HTML, CSS, and possibly React to design to front end.

## Tools/libraries/frameworks we will use
We will use Lehigh's authentication API or Google’s API.
